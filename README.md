CS441 - Android Project 2

Android Studio Application 
Project 2 Description (README)

For my second Android project, we were assigned to create an application that allows the user to draw on the screen and deal with user interaction. I utilized Android Studio to develop a painting application. The application is fairly simple to use. It consists of several different color buttons (red, blue, green, white, yellow, cyan, magenta, black) the user can pick from, the ability to change the dot size of the pen, and the clear canvas button. 
	
For the program, I gave the user a default color which is black and a default dot size. The user is able to change the color to his/her liking later on. I used colors found from android.graphics.Color and picked out mainly primary colors. The color options can be found on the top of the screen. On the bottom of the screen, there are the clear board button, and incrementation and decrementation buttons for the dot pen size. The user is given the ability to increase the dot size or decrease the dot size to a certain extent. There is a max dot size and min dot size set, so the user cannot go over or below limit. The clear board button simply clears everything off the screen except for the buttons and background, so the user can start off whenever he/she wishes. Before I dived into Android Studio and started coding, I drew out a simple and effective layout to the application. After that, I would drag button widgets to make sure they fit properly on the screen and then I implemented button functionalities. As I progress, I would modify other features such as the title/status bar, button design, background, etc.
